				<h1>A Cold Bottom is No Good...That is a Fact!!!</h1>
					<p></p>
					<p>Humor me for a minute, if you would please... and let's agree that "The Bowl" was created to facilitate man's process of nourishment intake. By design, dishes and silverware improved the way man interacted and experienced his daily rations.</p>
	                <p>Can we agree on this line of thought process? That yes indeed, that IS true....I will take it a little further and add that "The Bowl" is by far the most versitile  of these food service tools...I think it's worth mentioning, that be it solid (maccaroni and cheese), liquid (Chicken Broth), or both (Beef Stew), the "bowl" really outshines the plate in the categories of overall function and design. The Bowl is a multi-dimentional tool, where as the plate has far more limitations. That being said, I believe it is fair to say,"That if you are ever in doubt which type of dish to use in any given situation, "The BOWL" is definitely the way to go !!! You never know, you might find yourself faced with making that choice--plate or bowl...It is best for one to be prepared for such an occasion. So, which will you choose??? -- It could happen!...Now I've gone and forgot what I was talking about. Goodness gracious. Oh yes, the point is bowls are for eating,... and if you are a dog ... well, bowls are often used for drinking too. Agreed? Agreed.</p>
					<p>I must admit that my dog Li'l Bit threw me for a loop when I came out one chilly October morning to find this very site before my eyes....</p>
					<p></p>
				<h2>Exhibit "A"</h2>
					<p></p>
						<img src="https://pink-me-pleez.neocities.org/ButtInBowl.jpg">
					<p></p>
					<p>...jsut in case anyone is unsure of wha exactly they are seeing in the above photo, I will explain.</p>
					<p>We are looking at my dog, Li'l Bit. Li'l Bit does not care for the brisk air that accompanies  the change of the season from summer to fall. He simply does not love it.</p>
					<p>So when my dad bought a brand new water bowl made out of a black rubber type of material to replace the tupperware water bowl that Li'l Bit had eaten the day before, I was grateful. </p>
					<p>Everyone knows how important it is for a dog to have water to drink. It ranks pretty high on the scale of necessary items required for the continuance of life and such.</p>
					<p>Well, it turns out that Lil'l Bit feeels that it is necessary for him to NOT have to set his precious bare bottom on the cold concrete when the frost and chill of the early October mornings have not yet burned off for the day.</p>
					<p>As you can see in the photo (Exhibit "A"), Li'l Bit has long since dumped the water and opted to repurpose his brand new bowl into a seat cushion. I tried to explain to him that the bowl is designed to hold his water and not to sit in, but he will hear nothing of it. No sir.</p>
					<p> As far as Li'l Bit is concerned, a cold bottom is no good. He cannot tolerate sitting on that cold concretw and he refuses to subject himself to those intolerable conditions.</p>
					<p> Li'l Bit turns five this next year, in Febrary. He has been sitting in bowls starting in his first year of life. I am sure that not be something that will change. I will have to agree with Li'l Bit on this one_ "A cold bottom is no good,...That most certainly is a fact."
